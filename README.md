## ðŸŒŸ What's Inside?

### 1. **Basic Input and Output**
- Programs to handle input and output using:
  - `cout` for output
  - `cin` for input

### 2. **Data Types**
- Exploring and using:
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `double`
  - `const` for constants

### 3. **Comments**
- Programs demonstrating the use of:
  - Single-line comments (`//`)
  - Multi-line comments (`/* ... */`)

### 4. **Basic Topics**
- Simple programs that lay the foundation for understanding:
  - Variables
  - Constants
  - Basic arithmetic operations
